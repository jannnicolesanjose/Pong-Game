# Pong-Game
This Pong Game was a final project for our senior high school Python elective class, which included students from different strands since it was an optional subject. For our final requirement, we decided to recreate the classic Pong game using Python.

We worked together as a team, combining our ideas and skills to develop a functional and interactive game. The project made use of several Python libraries including pygame for the main game logic and visuals, tkinter for basic UI components, PIL for handling images, and mixer from pygame to add sound effects.

The game features the basic mechanics of Pong: two paddles, a ball, and a scoring system. One of the key learning experiences was integrating different libraries and managing game loops, collision detection, and event handling. Despite coming from different academic backgrounds, we successfully collaborated and brought the game to life through teamwork and shared interest in programming.
